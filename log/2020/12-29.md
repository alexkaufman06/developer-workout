Questions that come to mind as we embark on testinggit st micro frontends:
* How do we avoid duplication of dependencies?
    * Why? So we can keep our payload size minimal
* How do we avoid too much fragmentation in the way teams work?
    * Why? So it’s easier for us to understand each other’s codebases and their tests
* How do we handle independent deployment?
    * Why? So we can reduce the scope of any give deployment and reduce risk
* Shared components: testing and ownership/governance
* Who owns integration testing of the various micro frontends with the container application? And how do we keep these tests minimal?
* How do we scale our testing across applications?

Also: 
* Not a fan of iframes 
* How do we avoid CSS clashing amongst teams?
    * Why? So that developers can write their styles independently of each other with confidence
