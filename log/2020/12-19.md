### [BDD and Functional Testing](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/behavior-driven-development-bdd-and-functional-testing-62084ad7f1f2)

#### **Key Takeaways:**
* BDD is a branch of TDD
* BDD uses helps establish ubiquitous language within a domain that can be used for system tests such as User Acceptance Tests (UAT)
* **Black Box Testing:** Testing that ignore the implementation details of a system or component and focuses solely on the outputs generated in response to selected inputs and execution conditions.
* Functional tests help us build the right product (Validation)
* Unit tests help us build the product right (Verfication)

### [How Netflix Scales its API with GraphQL Federation (Part 1)](https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-scales-its-api-with-graphql-federation-part-1-ae3557c187e2)

#### **Key Takeaways:**
* Netflix is known for its loosely coupled and highly scalable microservice architecture
  * As the business has scaled, their ability to innovate rapidly approached an invisble asymptote (a line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance)
    * To address this problem, Netflix developed a federated GraphQL platform to power the API layer
* Rather than exposing 100s of microservice to UI developers, Netflix offers a unified API aggreagation layer at the edge
* Studio Engineering is building hundresds of applications to power workflows on content creation
* At one point the relationships between myriads of microservices became complex to manage. This was solved with two architecture patterns:
  * Single-use aggregation layers
    * BFFs
    * Mid-tier service
  * Materialized views
* They build a Graph API using GraphQL
  * This provided a unified abstraction on top of data and relationships
* Apollo released the GraphQL Federation Specification which Netflix adopted.
